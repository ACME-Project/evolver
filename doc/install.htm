<h1>Surface Evolver Aquisition and Installation</h1>

This chapter explains how to get and install the Evolver.
Evolver is written to be portable between systems. There
are pre-compiled versions for Windows and Macintosh; source
files and a Makefile are provided for unix/Linux systems.


  The distribution packages for various systems are available from the 
 <a href="http://www.susqu.edu/brakke/evolver/evolver.htm">Evolver homepage</a>.
 Each package also contains documentation and sample datafiles and
 scripts.  The documentation subdirectory is named <tt>doc</tt>, and
 contains the manual in PDF format, an HTML version of
 the documentation (except for the mathematical parts), and a brief
 unix man page evolver.1.  The HTML
 files are also used by the Evolver help command.
 The samples are in the subdirectory <tt>fe</tt> (which is the
file extension I use for datafiles; it stands for
 "facet-edge," referring to the internal structure of surfaces
 in the Evolver).

Below are instructions for standard packages:

Instructions for installing the Surface Evolver on unix-style systems.
<p>
Quick start:
<br>
1. Download <a href="http://www.susqu.edu/brakke/aux/downloads/evolver-2.30.tar.gz">evolver-2.30.tar.gz</a>. <br>
2. Unpack the Evolver archive.
<br>
3. In the src subdirectory, edit Makefile to uncomment the lines for
   your system.
<br>
4. Run "make".
<br>
5. Test by running "./evolver ../fe/cube.fe"
<p>

Detailed instructions:
<p>
1. The Evolver is distributed in a compressed tar archive
   <a href="http://www.susqu.edu/brakke/aux/downloads/evolver-2.30.tar.gz">evolver-2.30.tar.gz</a>,
   available from http://www.susqu.edu/brakke/evolver. Get this file into a 
   working directory.  The packed archive is about 2MB, unpacks to about 5MB.  
   You will probably need another 3 or 4 MB to compile.  
<p>

2. Uncompress the archive with <pre>
      gunzip evolver-2.30.tar.gz </pre>
   Extract the files with <pre>
      tar xvf evolver.tar  </pre>
   This will unpack into three subdirectories: src (source code),
   doc (the html version of the manual), and fe (sample datafiles).  
   The working directory will also contain a PDF version of the manual,
   and a man page, evolver.1.
<p>

3. Install the man page: copy evolver.1 to some appropriate place on your
   manpath, such as <nobr>/usr/local/share/man/man1</nobr>.
  You may have to become root to have permission to do this.
<p>

<a name="EVOLVERPATH">
4. Set the EVOLVERPATH environment variable: Evolver needs to find the initial 
   datafile and sometimes other files (e.g. command files for the "read" 
   command, the help documentation files). If the named file is not in the 
   current directory, then an  environment variable called EVOLVERPATH will be 
   consulted for a directory search list. The datafile directory and the 
   directory with the HTML documentation files should definitely be included.
   The format is the same as the usual PATH environment variable.  Set it up 
   as usual in your system, in .profile or .login or .cshrc or wherever:
<p>

   Unix C shell:<pre>
     setenv EVOLVERPATH /usr/you/evolver/fe:/usr/you/evolver/doc 
</pre>
<p>
   Bourne shell:  <pre>
     EVOLVERPATH=/usr/you/evolver/fe:/usr/you/evolver/doc
     export EVOLVERPATH 
</pre>
   See <a href="#EVOLVERPATH (Windows)">here</a> for setting 
EVOLVERPATH in Windows.
<p>

5. Change to the src subdirectory of your Evolver directory.

<p>
6. Modify Makefile for your system. Makefile begins with sets of macro 
   definitions for various systems.   If your system is listed, remove the 
   comment symbols '#' from start of the appropriate lines. If your system 
   is not there, use the GENERIC lines, or set up your own. If you do define 
   your own, be sure to put a corresponding section in include.h.
<p>

7. In Makefile, edit the CFLAGS line to have the proper options (optimization, 
   floating point option, etc.).
<p>

8. In Makefile, GRAPH should be the name of a screen graphics interface file.  
   Use glutgraph.o if possible; most systems have OpenGL/GLUT graphics now.  
   GLUT graphics uses a separate thread to display graphics, so if you use 
   GLUT, you must put <nobr>-DPTHREADS</nobr> in CFLAGS and put 
   <nobr>-lpthread</nobr> in GRAPHLIB.
   If not using GLUT, for primitive X windows graphics you can use xgraph.o.  
   For no built-in screen graphics at all you can use nulgraph.o. GRAPHLIB 
   should be the appropriate graphics library plus any other libraries needed.
<p>

9. If you want to use parallel processes on a multiprocessor machine, 
   put <nobr>-DPTHREADS</nobr> in CFLAGS and put <nobr>-lpthread</nobr> 
   in GRAPHLIB. Currently, the
   only calculations done in parallel are basic energies and named quantities.
   The number of processes actually done in parallel can be controlled
   with the <nobr>-p n</nobr> command line option.
<p>

10. If you want Evolver to be able to use geomview, 
    include <nobr>-DOOGL</nobr> in CFLAGS.
<p>

11. If you want Evolver to operate in a higher space dimension than the
    the default maximum of 4, include <nobr>-DMAXCOORD=n</nobr> in CFLAGS, 
    where n is
    the maximum space dimension. This sets the upper limit of dimensionality, 
    and is used for allocating space in data structures. 
<p>

12. If your system supports the long double data type, you can compute and
    print values in higher precision by compiling with 
    <nobr>-DLONGDOUBLE</nobr> in CFLAGS. 
    But this slows computations, and should be used only by precision fanatics.
<p>
<a name="metis install"></a>
13. If you wish to use the commands based on the METIS partitioning
    software (metis, kmetis, body_metis, and metis_factor), then
    you should download the METIS package from,
    <a href="http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~karypis/metis/">
      http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~karypis/metis/</a>
    and "make" the library libmetis.a (on some systems, make complains it
    cannot find ranlib, but the resulting libmetis.a still works).
    In Evolver's Makefile, add <nobr>-DMETIS</nobr> to CFLAGS, and 
    add <nobr>-lmetis</nobr> to GRAPHLIB. 
    You will probably also have to add <nobr>-L metispath</nobr>  
    to GRAPHLIB to tell
    the linker where to find libmetis.a.  Note that METIS is incorporated
    in the Windows executable.  If you are using hessian commands on very 
    large surfaces, then metis_factor can be much faster than the other 
    sparse matrix factoring schemes in Evolver, and I highly recommend it.
<p>

14. From the shell command prompt in the src directory, run "make".  This
    will produce the Evolver executable file named "evolver" in the src
    directory.  If there are errors, hopefully you will only have to change 
    the system-specific parts of Makefile and include.h to get things to work.  
    If significant changes to other files are needed, let me know at
    brakke@susqu.edu.
<p>

15. Copy the evolver executable to someplace on your PATH, such as
    <nobr>$HOME/bin</nobr> or <nobr>/usr/local/bin</nobr>, 
    or make a link someplace on your PATH to 
    the evolver executable.
<p>
 
16. Test by opening a new shell and running "evolver cube".  Now you
    should be able to follow the tutorials in the HTML manual
    or the printed manual.

<p>

<p>
<a name="geomview install"></a><h4>Installing geomview</h4>
If your system does not have OpenGL/GLUT, I suggest you
get the 
<a href="http://www.geomview.org/download/">
geomview package</a> from The Geometry
Center. There are pre-compiled binaries for many unix systems here.
Follow geomview's installation directions, and make sure that geomview
is accessible through your <tt>PATH</tt>.  NOTE: The X windows versions
of geomview seem to require some event to occur in the geomview display
window  before it will redraw after loading a new datafile.  So if 
geomview seems hung, just run the mouse over the window to give it an
event to wake it up.

<h2><a name="windows version">MS-Windows 95/98, Windows NT/2000/XP/2003</a></h2>


 The file
 <a href="http://www.susqu.edu/brakke/aux/downloads/evolver230-Win32.zip">
 evolver230-Win32.zip</a>
 has the executable file evolver.exe along with the documentation and sample
 datafile subdirectories.
 Create a directory (such as C:\evolver),
 and unzip the distribution package there.  You can leave evolver.exe
 there and add c:\evolver to your PATH, or you can copy evolver.exe
 to someplace in your PATH, such as C:\windows\system32.
<p>
 <a name="EVOLVERPATH (Windows)"></a>
 You should
 also create an environment variable EVOLVERPATH telling Evolver where
 to search for various files.  Do this by opening
 Control Panel/System/Advanced/Environment Variables, clicking New
 under System Variables, entering EVOLVERPATH for the Variable name,
 and <tt>c:\evolver\fe;c:\evolver\doc</tt> for the Variable value.  You may
 add further paths of your own to this list if you wish.
<p>
 To make Evolver start automatically when you click on a *.fe file,
 you can associate Evolver with the file extension .fe by opening
 My Computer/Tools/Folder Options/File Types/New, entering the
 File Extension fe, clicking OK, clicking Change, and browsing
 for the evolver.exe program. (This sequence of actions may vary
 on different Windows versions.)
<p>
 The Windows version
 uses OpenGL/GLUT graphics.  OpenGL is standard in Windows, and
 all the necessary GLUT components are included in the executable,
 so you don't have to install anything.

<h2><a name="macOSX version">Macintosh OSX version</a></h2>

 I am not a Mac person, and the Mac OSX version is just a port
 of the unix version, so there are no Mac bells and whistles.
<p>
 Quick start: <br>
 1.  Download
 <a href="http://www.susqu.edu/brakke/aux/downloads/Evolver230-OSX.tar.gz">
 Evolver230-OSX.tar.gz</a>.
 <br>
 2. Open the Evolver230-OSX folder and double-click on the evolver file.
 <br>
 3. Evolver prompts for a file; tell it fe/cube
 <br>
 4. You should now be able to follow the tutorial in the manual.
 <br>
 <p>
 Detailed instructions: <p>
 1.  Download
 <a href="http://www.susqu.edu/brakke/aux/downloads/Evolver230-OSX.tar.gz">
 Evolver230-OSX.tar.gz</a>.
 <p>
 2. The download probably created a folder Evolver230-OSX on your
 desktop.  This folder really has a unix path something like
 /Users/yourname/Evolver230-OSX.  These notes will mostly refer
 to the terminal command line, so you should be able to open a
 terminal and use a command line prompt.
<p>
 3. The Evolver230-OSX folder has the executable file evolver, the
 samples folder fe, the documentation folder doc, a PDF version
 of the manual, and a man page evolver.1.  
<p>
 4. Move the executable to some place on your PATH, e.g.
 <pre>   cp evolver /Users/yourname/bin </pre>
 or add the Evolver folder to your PATH. 
 <p>
 5.
 You should also create an environment
 variable EVOLVERPATH containing paths to the fe and doc folders by
 placing the following line in your shell initialization file, with
 appropriate modifications.  You can tell which shell you are running
 by running the ps command at the command prompt.
 <p> C Shell (csh, tcsh): put the following in /Users/yourname/.cshrc or
  /Users/yourname/.tcshrc:
 <pre> setenv EVOLVERPATH /Users/yourname/Evolver230-OSX/fe:/Users/yourname/Evolver230-OSX/doc </pre>
   Bourne shell (sh,bash): put the following in /Users/yourname/.profile
  or /Users/yourname/.bashrc:  <pre>
     EVOLVERPATH=/usr/you/evolver/fe:/usr/you/evolver/doc
     export EVOLVERPATH </pre>
<p>
  6. Install the man page by copying evolver.1 to some place on your
  manpath, e.g. <pre>
     cp evolver.1 /usr/share/man/man1 </pre>
  You may have to become root to have permission to do this.
<p>
  7. Test by opening a new shell and running "evolver cube".  Now you
 should be able to follow the tutorials in the HTML manual or printed
 manual.
<p>
  8. If you wish to compile your own version of the Evolver, and have
  a C compiler, then follow the <a href="#unix version">unix instructions</a>.

<h2><a name="Mac OS9 version">Macintosh OS 9 version</a></h2>
 There is a Mac PowerPC OS9  version available as
<a href="http://www.susqu.edu/brakke/evolver/downloads/Evolver220-OS9.sit.hqx">
<tt>Evolver220-OS9.sit.hqx</tt></a>.  
  It includes a README file with Mac specific information and datafiles 
  in Mac format.  
<p>
The archive file contains:
<ul>
<li>     README.MAC - Mac-specific information.
<li>     EvolverPPC - the application executable file.
<li>     fe -  folder of sample datafiles and scripts in Mac format (CR as end-of-line).
<li>     doc   - folder of HTML documentation and help files.
<li>     manual220.pdf - manual in Adobe PDF format.
</ul>     
<p>
Installation:  All you need to do is unpack in a directory somewhere.  The 
datafiles can go in a different directory, but then you will have to supply
path names when using them.
<p>
<h4>Mac OS9 version idiosyncracies: </h4>
  This is a bare-bones port, so there are few Mac
bells and whistles like menus.  There are two windows: a text window and a
graphics window.  The text window provides a command-line interface to Evolver.
Commands are typed in and text output appears here.  All text input will go to
the text window when either the text or graphics window is in front, so you
can keep the graphics window in front while typing commands.  Dragging the mouse
in the graphics window will cause the object to rotate in 3D around an axis
perpendicular to the mouse drag and with an angle proportional to the length of
the drag.  The redraw occurs after the mouse is released, not during the drag.
Redrawing occurs in the background, so there may be some delay until the picture
appears.
<p>
At start-up, you will be asked to enter the name of a datafile in the text window.
If the file is not in the same directory, you will have to give the path also.
For a Mac, the path character is a colon.  Leading colons on the path go
to parent folders.
<p>
Interrupting a repeating command:
Hit command-period.   Will complete current command and return to
command prompt.
<p>
Memory partition:  The default partition size is 8 Meg.  Evolver will run in 
2 Meg, but your surfaces won't be able to be very complex.  I suggest making
the partition as large as you can.  You can change the partition size with Finder 
GetInfo.
